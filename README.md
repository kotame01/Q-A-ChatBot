# 🤖 NLP-Based Chatbot using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic conversational chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

The chatbot is designed to understand user queries by identifying the intent behind the input text and generating an appropriate response based on trained classification models.

The notebook walks through the complete workflow including text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization, intent classification, and response generation.
